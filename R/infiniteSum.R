#' Approximates the sum of a positive discrete infinite series with a single
#' maximum
#'
#' For series that pass the ratio test, the approximation is analytically
#' guaranteed to have an error that is smaller than epsilon. This can
#' occasionally not happen due to floating point arithmetic.
#' @param logFunction The function that returns the series absolute value
#' \ifelse{html}{\out{|a<sub>n</sub>|}}{\eqn{|a_n|}} in
#' the log scale. If it is an alternating series, this is defined in
#' argument \code{alternate}. Can either be an \code{R} function or a string
#' indicating one of the precompiled functions. See \code{\link{precompiled}}
#' for a list of available functions. If defined in \code{R}, the function's
#' definition must have two arguments. The first argument must be the integer
#' argument equivalent to \eqn{n} in
#' \ifelse{html}{\out{a<sub>n</sub>}}{\eqn{a_n}} and the second must be a vector
#' of numeric parameters.
#' @param parameters A numeric vector with parameters used in logFunction.
#' Vectorized summation over various parameter values sets is not implemented.
#' Use \code{\link{apply}} or their variants to achieve this.
#' @param logL The log of the limit value of
#' \ifelse{html}{\out{a<sub>n+1</sub>/a<sub>n</sub>}}{\eqn{a_{n+1}/a_n}} which
#' must be smaller than 1, or smaller than 0 in the log scale. Ignored if the
#' series is alternating, defined with argument \code{alternate}. If left as
#' \code{NULL} and \code{logFunction} is defined in \code{R}, the
#' \code{batches} algorithm with default settings is used. See 'details'.
#' @param alternate Either -1, 0 or 1. If 0, the series is not alternating.
#' Otherwise, the series is alternating where the first element's sign is
#' either 1 or -1, as entered in this parameter. If not 0, arguments \code{logL}
#' and \code{forceAlgorithm} are ignored.
#' @param epsilon The desired error margin for the approximation. See 'details'.
#' @param maxIter The maximum number of iterations for the approximation. In
#' most cases, this number will not be reached unless it is very small. A value
#' too high is not recommended as an array of this size is reserved in memory
#' during the algorithm.
#' @param n0 The sum will be approximated for the series starting at this value.
#' @param forceAlgorithm A value to control which summation algorithm to use.
#' Ignored if the series is alternating, defined with argument \code{alternate}.
#' See 'details'.
#' @return A list with two named members, \code{sum} and \code{n}. \code{sum} is
#' the approximated value in the log scale and \code{n} is the total number of
#' iterations, that is, the number of times the function was evaluated.
#' @details The approximated sum is based on some theoretical results which,
#' analytically, guarantee that the approximation will be within \code{epsilon}
#' distance to the true value. It is possible that the numerical result fails
#' to fall in this distance due to floating point arithmetic. The \code{C} code
#' under the hood is being continuously reviewed to minimize this problem. They
#' seem to occur more often when the series decays very fast to zero or when the
#' total is a large number.
#'
#' For these theoretical results to work, the series must pass the ratio test,
#' which means that the ratio
#' \ifelse{html}{\out{a<sub>n+1</sub>/a<sub>n</sub>}}{\eqn{a_{n+1}/a_n}} must
#' converge to a number \eqn{L < 1} when \eqn{n} goes to infinity. The log of
#' \eqn{L} should be provided to the function for a better approximation.
#' Otherwise, a warning will be given and the program will try to estimate its
#' value, however, the theoretical result that guarantees the approximation does
#' not necessarily hold in this case.
#'
#' Another requirement in the current installment of this function is that the
#' series must have only a single maximum. This is the case for most discrete
#' probability distributions and marginalization problems. This limitation
#' will be addressed in the future.
#'
#' There are currently two implemented algorithms that perform the calculations.
#' The first, called Sum-To-Threshold, sums the series values until the series
#' values are smaller than \code{epsilon}. This is the fastest algorithm, but
#' it is only guaranteed to provide an approximation within the desired error
#' margin when \eqn{L < 0.5}.
#'
#' The second algorithm, called Error bounding pairs is based on a more general
#' result which works for any \eqn{0 \le L < 1}. This algorithm sums the series
#' until
#'
#' \ifelse{html}{\out{|a<sub>n+1</sub>/(1-L) - a<sub>n+1</sub> a<sub>n</sub>/(a<sub>n</sub> - a<sub>n+1</sub>)| < 2 Îµ.}}{\deqn{\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{1-L} - \frac{a_{n+1}a_n}{a_n-a_{n+1}}\right| < 2 \epsilon.}}
#'
#' Then the approximation is the added values of the sum plus
#'
#' \ifelse{html}{\out{ 0.5 (a<sub>n+1</sub>/(1-L) + a<sub>n+1</sub> a<sub>n</sub>/(a<sub>n</sub> - a<sub>n+1</sub>))}}{\deqn{0.5 (\frac{a_{n+1}}{1-L} + \frac{a_{n+1}a_n}{a_n-a_{n+1}}).}}
#'
#' The Error bounding pairs method usually requires less function evaluations
#' than the Sum-To-Threshold one, however the convergence checking is more
#' demanding, which means that it is typically slower, albeit slightly. If
#' \eqn{L = 0}, the convergence checking can be reduced and the Error bounding
#' pairs becomes almost as fast as the Sum-To-Threshold method.
#' 
#' The third algorithm is called batches method and is used when \eqn{L} is
#' unknown. Its use requires some fine tuning, so there is a standalone function
#' for it called \code{\link{infiniteSum_batches}}. Its use and functionality
#' can be seen in its own documentation. When used as a result of this function,
#' default settings are used.
#'
#' The \code{forceAlgorithm} parameter can be used to
#' control which algorithm to use. When it is 0, the program automatically
#' selects the Sum-to-threshold when \eqn{L < 0.5} and the Error bounding pairs
#' when \eqn{0.5 \le L < 1}. Method batches is selected when \eqn{L} is left
#' \code{NULL}. If \code{forceAlgorithm} is set to 1, the Sum-To-Threshold
#' algorithm is forced. If it is 2, then the Error bounding pairs is forced. A
#' small note, the Error bounding pairs algorithm can go up to \code{maxIter} +
#' 1 function evaluations. This is due to its convergence checking dependence on
#' \ifelse{html}{\out{a<sub>n+1</sub>}}{\eqn{a_{n+1}}}. Finally, if the
#' parameter is set as 3, the batches algorithm is used with default settings.
#' 
#' If the series is alternating, the Sum-To-Threshold convergence condition on
#' the series absolute value guarantees the result, regardless of the ratio
#' limit.
#'
#' The function to be summed can be an R function or a string naming the
#' precompiled function in the package. The list of precompiled functions can
#' be found in \code{\link{precompiled}}, and more functions will be added in
#' time. As is intuitive, using a precompiled function is much faster than using
#' an \code{R} function. In fact, it has been observed to be dozens time faster.
#'
#' The advanced user can program their own precompiled functions and use the
#' package's summation algorithms by linking the appropriate header file. See
#' the \href{https://github.com/GuidoAMoreira/sumR}{GitHub} readme for the a
#' quick tutorial.
#' @seealso \code{\link{precompiled}} provides a list with precompiled functions
#' that can be used for the summation. \code{\link{infiniteSum_batches}} is
#' an alternate method which does not require knowledge of the \code{logL}
#' argument.
#' @examples
