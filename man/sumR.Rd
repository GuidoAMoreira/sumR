\title{sumR: Approximate series withing a desired error margin}
\description{
The \code{\pkg{sumR}} package provides some \code{R} functions that allow the
user to approximate the sum of series. It also interfaces the low level
\code{C} functions that perform the actual summation, so that other packages
can apply them to their own functions written in \code{C} or \code{C++}. The
\href{github.com/GuidoAMoreira/sumR}{GitHub} page provides a short tutorial
on how to achieve this.
}
\details{
The underlying code is under frequent revision for improvements in speed,
memory use and precision. As the need to implement other summation algorithms
arise, they will be added.

The theoretical foundations for the approximations will be submitted to a
peer-reviewed journal shortly.
